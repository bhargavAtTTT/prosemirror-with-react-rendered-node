# ProseMirror with a React Rendered Node

![screen recording](screen-recording.gif?raw=true)

Open index.html in a browser. Use the "insert orange" button to insert a document node that renders as a React component.

## Local development

If you'd like to modify the files:

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

Install npm dependencies

```js
npm install
```

Then run the build process, which will recompile on file changes:

```js
node build.js
````
